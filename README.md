# NotesML
Welcome to my Machine Learning Notes repository! This repository is organized into three main folders:

## Folders
### 1. Theory
- Contains my notes about Machine Learning concepts and theory.
- I use Obsidian for writing and organizing my theoretical notes.
### 2. Practice
- Includes practice exercises and code snippets.
- I use Jupyter Notebook to work on exercises from platforms like Kaggle and to explore key libraries such as:
   - Numpy 
   - Pandas
   - Matplotlib
   - Scikit-learn, etc.
### 3. Projects
- Features my own Machine Learning projects.
- Each project includes its own folder with relevant code, data, and documentation.
